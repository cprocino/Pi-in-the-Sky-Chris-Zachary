# Planning
## Objective
Collect flight data using mpu, barometer, ect. and save it to the pico. Create a mechanism to safely return the pico to the ground so that the flight data can be downloaded.
## Proposed Solutions
We have decided to construct either a one or two stage rocket to collect flight data. Both rockets will use a parachute to land
| **1 Stage Rocket** | **2 Stage Rocket** |
| ----- | ----- |
|**Pros:** A one stage rocket is simpiler because there is no stage seperation. Will not go as high so less space is needed for launch. Uses less material and has only one motor so it will be cheaper | **Pros:** Way cooler and will get much higher alowing us to record more data. |
| **Cons:** Might not get as high | **Cons:** Uses more material and needs more space to launch. If the second stage does not fire at the right time the rocket could fire towards the ground. |
